## What Was Done (Session 3) -- Phase 1: Auth, projects, team, dashboard

1. **Supabase project configured** -- Connected Supabase project (ref: ijfgwzacaabzeknlpaff), added env vars to `.env.local` and Vercel dashboard. Created `lib/supabase/client.ts`, `server.ts`, `middleware.ts` using `@supabase/ssr`. Ran `001_core_tables.sql` migration (projects, team_members, milestones, communications, activity_log + RLS + `handle_new_user()` trigger).

2. **Route group restructure** -- Moved all marketing pages into `app/(marketing)/` route group to fix nested `<html><body>` issue that was causing Vercel build failures. Root `app/layout.tsx` stripped to minimal; `app/(marketing)/layout.tsx` holds StarsCanvas, Navbar, Footer. Committed: `60d434d`.

3. **Phase 1 build** -- Auth (login page, middleware session guard), project CRUD (list/new/detail/edit), team workload page with utilization bars, dashboard with KPI cards and project table. Files: `app/command-center/login/page.tsx`, `app/command-center/dashboard/page.tsx`, `app/command-center/projects/`, `app/command-center/team/page.tsx`, `components/command-center/`. Committed: `1ea7010`.

4. **Vercel build fixes** -- Added `export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'` to all CC server pages to prevent static prerender errors. Fixed lucide-react missing dependency. Committed: `9cd088c`.

## What Was Done (Session 4) -- Phase 2: Communications, budget, knowledge base

1. **Communications log** -- Global feed with QuickAddComm form (project, channel, direction, contact, subject, summary, action items) and CommFeed with channel/action-item filters. Files: `app/command-center/communications/page.tsx`, `components/command-center/communications/QuickAddComm.tsx`, `components/command-center/communications/CommFeed.tsx`.

2. **Budget tracking** -- Budget health meter (green <80%, yellow 80-100%, red >100%), remaining budget display, over-budget warning banner embedded in project detail tabs. Files: `components/command-center/projects/ProjectTabs.tsx`.

3. **Knowledge base (markdown)** -- Reads `.md` files from `command-center/knowledge/` using gray-matter, groups by category, renders with react-markdown + remark-gfm + @tailwindcss/typography. Added design system doc and stack guide. Files: `app/command-center/knowledge/`, `components/command-center/knowledge/KnowledgeContent.tsx`, `command-center/knowledge/docs/design-system.md`, `command-center/knowledge/docs/stack-guide.md`.

4. **Project tabs** -- Tabbed project detail view: Overview / Milestones / Budget / Communications, all rendered from a single page. Fixed TypeScript error with Supabase joined relations returning arrays. Committed: `da82b56`.

## What Was Done (Session 5) -- Chatbots KB management

1. **Chatbots section** -- Full CRUD for chatbots (name, type, client, linked project, status, description). Sidebar nav entry added. Files: `app/command-center/chatbots/page.tsx`, `new/page.tsx`, `[id]/page.tsx`, `[id]/edit/page.tsx`, `components/command-center/chatbots/ChatbotForm.tsx`.

2. **KB entry management** -- Per-chatbot knowledge base entries stored in Supabase (`chatbot_kb_entries` table). Entries grouped by category (about, tone, products, pricing, faq, policies, support, general, other) with word counts. Create/edit/delete with markdown textarea. Files: `app/command-center/chatbots/[id]/entries/`, `components/command-center/chatbots/KBEntryForm.tsx`, `components/command-center/chatbots/KBEntryList.tsx`.

3. **Export** -- Client-side export button concatenates all entries into one structured `.md` file sorted by category, triggers browser download. File: `components/command-center/chatbots/KBExportButton.tsx`.

4. **Supabase migration** -- Created `supabase/migrations/002_chatbots.sql` with `chatbots` and `chatbot_kb_entries` tables + RLS. Committed: `4cdb302`.

## What Was Done (Session 6) -- Phase 3: Infrastructure monitoring

1. **Infrastructure types** -- Shared TypeScript types for Supabase Management API, Railway GraphQL, and Vercel REST responses including provider health, projects, services, and deployments. File: `lib/infrastructure/types.ts`.

2. **Provider clients** -- Three typed API wrappers that gracefully handle missing/invalid keys with `not_configured` status. Supabase Management API fetches project list and health. Railway GraphQL queries projects, services, and recent deployments. Vercel REST fetches projects and deployments. Files: `lib/infrastructure/supabase-mgmt.ts`, `lib/infrastructure/railway.ts`, `lib/infrastructure/vercel.ts`.

3. **API route** -- Auth-protected `GET /api/infrastructure` endpoint that fetches all three providers in parallel and returns a unified `InfrastructureOverview` response. File: `app/api/infrastructure/route.ts`.

4. **Infrastructure dashboard** -- Replaced placeholder page with full monitoring dashboard. Features: service health cards (color-coded status badges), Supabase and Vercel project detail tables, combined Railway+Vercel deployment list with relative timestamps, auto-refresh every 60s, manual refresh button, loading skeletons, setup guide when API keys aren't configured. Files: `app/command-center/infrastructure/page.tsx`, `components/command-center/infrastructure/ServiceCard.tsx`, `components/command-center/infrastructure/DeploymentList.tsx`, `components/command-center/infrastructure/InfraClient.tsx`. Committed: `9622fb5`.

5. **Anthropic API key** -- Added real API key to `.env.local` (user also added to Vercel env vars for production). Ready for Phase 4 AI features.

## What Was Done (Session 7) -- RLS fix, params migration, knowledge fix

1. **RLS infinite recursion fix** -- `team_members` had a self-referencing "Admins can manage team members" policy causing 500 errors on all writes. Created `public.is_admin()` SECURITY DEFINER function, replaced all recursive admin policies across 5 tables (team_members, projects, milestones, communications, activity_log). Also set user role to `admin`. Applied via Supabase SQL Editor.

2. **Async params migration** -- Updated all 7 dynamic pages to use `Promise<>` params type (Next.js 15 requirement): project detail, project edit, chatbot detail, chatbot edit, KB entry new, KB entry edit, knowledge slug. Committed: `a29ed75`.

3. **Knowledge page crash fix** -- `gray-matter` auto-parses YAML dates into JavaScript Date objects, which are not valid React children (React error #31). Fixed by coercing `updated` and `tags` fields to strings via `String()`. Committed: `0950e01`.

4. **Vercel file tracing** -- Added `experimental.outputFileTracingIncludes` to `next.config.js` so knowledge `.md` files are bundled into Vercel serverless functions. Committed: `a29ed75`.

5. **Royal Stroje project added** -- First project entered in Command Center (Vercel FE + Supabase, no Railway).

## What To Do Next

| Priority | Task | Notes |
|----------|------|-------|
| 1 | Enter remaining 9 projects in Command Center | Royal Stroje done; 4 more active + 5 in analysis |
| 2 | Fix knowledge page date display | Dates render as full UTC strings; format to YYYY-MM-DD |
| 3 | Add remaining knowledge base docs | Skills docs for wrap/save/doc-update, howto guides for Railway/Supabase/Vercel |
| 4 | Phase 4: AI features | Anthropic key is ready; chatbot AI responses, project summaries, etc. |
| 5 | SEO action plan implementation | Follow seo-audit/ACTION-PLAN.md recommendations (lower priority) |
